<p> 
              I'm Stephen Zimmermann, Electrical Controls Engineer with 10+ years of expertise in programming and automating industruial equipment. 
            </p> 
            <p>I am working on translating my current skills (always trying to learn new ones) into a Data Scienctist with an emphasis on Machine Learning .</p>

 <p class = "">
              I enrolled in University of California, Berkeley's Data Analytic Program in March 2022 besides my full time engineering job to help kickstart my transistion and have since learned: 
             <ul> <il> - VBA </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Python (VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, API Interactions ) </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Databases (ETL, SQL, pdAdmin, MongoDB) </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Front End Web (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Geomapping Leaflet) </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Data Visualization with Tableau </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - R programming </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Big Data Analytic with Spark  </ul></il> 
			 <ul> <il> - Maching Learning  </ul></il> 
             <ul> <il> - Realized I can always learn new things and new ways to apply my current skills! </ul></il> 
            </p>
